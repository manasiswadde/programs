Complete the code fragment to read two integer inputs from keyboard and find the quotient and remainder
  
  code:
 import java.util.Scanner;
 public class Program1{
       public static void main(String[] args) {
	   Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
	   int x=sc.nextInt();
	   int y=sc.nextInt();
//code for quotient and remainder
       
     System.out.println("The Quotient is = "+(x/y));
     System.out.print("The Remainder is = "+(x%y));
}
}

output:-
-756
8
The Quotient is = -94\n
The Remainder is = -4
